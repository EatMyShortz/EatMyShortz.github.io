    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered by keep on trying to do my work when i was stuck, without putting my hand up and going 'sir, sir my games not working' and try figuring it out instead. Sometimes i did put my hand up and ask for help. Sometimes i could of easily figured it out myself and i wasn’t thinking and sometimes i was completely stuck but most of the time my hand was down and i was working or trying other peoples games and giving them advice.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I was questioning myself about what i should do to improve in my work. Some of those questions i had to sit and think about and some of them i just knew the answers straight of the bat. I think that if i hadn’t questioned myself i wouldn’t of been able to do the work that i have accomplished.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Most of the work that i did was by myself, without asking a friend or teacher, but some of it i needed a little extra boost with some help. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected back on the past works we’ve done (space invaders and how to move a sprite smoothly) and that has helped me a lot with my work. It has especially helped me with my bomb drop because we did a bullet on space invaders and i just made the positives negative and it worked with a bit more added. It also helped with my random generator since we did that in space invaders too.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I have listened in all the lessons what the teacher or even my friends had to say. A put my hand up to answer questions even if they were wrong. I try asking what was needed to be asked and answering what was needed to be answered and i tried to help people and engage with the work</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could of tried not to get distracted with other people talking and carried on with my game. Also i could of stayed coding or playing my game not playing others. I could of not asked silly questions to the teacher since this just slows me down because i could of figured it out already also adding to that i could think about just asking questions since i probably know them or i’ve done it in previous work.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to not get distracted off my work and talk to others because that’ll slow me down and not help me at all unless they talk about how i could improve my work. I can wait to play others games when we evaluate them and i can sit down and think about the question before i ask it to a teacher or a friend</td>
